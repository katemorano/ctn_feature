    <p> The threatened closure of Downstate University Hospital by SUNY and Gov. Kathy Hochul has sparked anger and indignation among Brooklyn residents and the medical staff who treat them. </p>
    <p> Downstate hospital doctors and staff members passionately defended the hospital in virtual panel discussions March 15 and March 20, which were led by UUP President Fred Kowal. </p>
    <p> Over 100 people attended each meeting, where Kowal expressed incredulity about the plan to shutter the hospital. </p>
    <p> "SUNY is calling its vision for Downstate a transformation, but it is anything but that," Kowal said. "Let's call this what it is: SUNY is closing Downstate. </p>
    <p> "If you moved the programs offered at my home campus, SUNY Cobleskill, to nearby colleges and turned the campus into a shopping center, do you still have a SUNY Cobleskill?" Kowal asked. "Of course not. And that's what's happening at Downstate. If there's no building, there's no hospital." </p>
    <p> The discussions, hosted by UUP, focused on the dramatic impact Downstate's closure would have on health care services in Brooklyn—especially for low-income people of color. Panelists also warned of the potentially dire consequences that closing the hospital would have for patients requiring obstetrical care, kidney transplants and treatment of diabetes. </p>
    <p> “We want to talk about a plan that would have drastic, perhaps tragic effects on health care in Central Brooklyn, while also devastating the education of the next generation of medical professionals,” Kowal said. “We are part of the Central Brooklyn community, the heartbeat of that community.” </p>

    <h4> March 15 Discussion </h4>

    <p> Nelcia Trim, nurse manager of Downstate's Medical Intensive Care Unit, has worked at the hospital for 39 years. She has seen countless patients pass through the hospital and noted that many will recognize her and thank her even after their time at the hospital has ended. </p>
    <p> “What's going to happen to our people in this community?” Trim asked. “We put out so many good doctors here. We are Brooklyn.” </p>
    <p> Kowal and the other panelists pointed out New York's obligation to fund Downstate, a state hospital, and noted the absurdity of SUNY's claims that the hospital is not profitable.</p>
    <p> “If there is any money lost, it's because we are taking care of patients that can't pay, which is what the state is supposed to be doing,” said Dr. Matthew Pincus, professor of pathology at SUNY Downstate School of Medicine. He pointed out that at least half of Downstate's patients are uninsured. </p>
    <p> “They want to close a facility that is providing the very thing the state is supposed to be providing. It's inconceivable,” Pincus said. “How are you going to send these people to these hospitals that can't accommodate them?” </p>
    <p> Dr. Ann Harris, who works in Downstate's cardiac electrophysiology department, called Downstate the “Columbia Presbyterian” of Brooklyn, and noted that Downstate provides care which other nearby hospitals cannot provide. </p>
    <p> “King's County does not have an interventional cath lab. They are sending their patients to come see us for specialized care,” Harris said. She noted that the next-closest hospital is New York Presbyterian Brooklyn-Methodist Hospital, which is a 30-minute drive from Downstate with traffic. </p>
    <p> “For every minute that a patient experiences symptoms of a heart attack without treatment, they lose heart muscle. Time is everything,” Harris said. </p>

        <h3> "At the end of the day, we are fighting for a cause that is just. We are on the right side of history." </h3>
        <h5> -- UUP President Fred Kowal</h5>

    <h4> March 20 Discussion </h4>

    <p> Medical staff and lawmakers reinforced the already-strong case that Downstate is a valuable part of Central Brooklyn and that closing it would be deadly for the community. </p>
    <p> Dr. Allen Norin, professor of cell biology and director of transplant immunology at Downstate, noted that the kidney transplant enter performs around 60 transplants each year, and called the chancellor's plan to move the program elsewhere a pipe dream. </p>
    <p> “This is a federal program and King's County can't absorb that program. It's just not feasible,” Norin said. He noted that those who cannot travel to Manhattan would die prematurely from lack of transplant. His colleague Dr. Robert Foronjy, chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the hospital, affirmed that many Downstate patients cannot easily travel to Manhattan. </p>
    <p> Also joining was Dr. Christopher Lange, professor of radiation oncology at Downstate's medical school, who noted that the most profitable programs have already been closed at Downstate, which defies logic if the state expects the hospital to improve its financial straits. </p>
    <p> “The whole thing is upside down in terms of its logic,” Lange said. </p>
    <p> During the discussions, Kowal highlighted the importance of the work done by these medical professionals and UUP members to save Downstate. “At the end of the day, we are fighting for a cause that is just,” Kowal said. “We are on the right side of history.” </p>
